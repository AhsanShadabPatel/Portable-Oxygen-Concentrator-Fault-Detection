🫁 Portable Oxygen Concentrator with Fault Detection
📌 Overview

This project presents the design and implementation of a portable oxygen concentrator based on Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) combined with an oxygen analyzer and fault detection system. The system is intended for medical and emergency use, especially in regions with limited access to oxygen cylinders or stable electricity.

The project integrates hardware design, embedded systems, sensors, and communication modules to ensure safe and reliable oxygen delivery.
